## TAUTZ LABORATORY GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS PROTOCOLS

Laboratory protocols for scanning and landmarking samples for geometric-morphometric analysis, developed for use by the [Diethard Tautz](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/15929/evolutionarygenetics) Laboratory at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en) in Plön, Germany. These protocols significantly simplify the respective manuals of each system being utilized.

### *File Descriptions*

- ***01. CT-Scanning.docx*** — Protocol for scanning skulls with the Scanco Medical ‘VivaCT 40’ Small Animal Preclinical Microtomography Scanner, using the ‘μCT V6.1’ scanning program, adapted from the the 'VivaCT 40 User's Guide' ([TD-153 Rev. 4.4](http://www.scanco.ch/fileadmin/webmaster_img/Documents/Manual_vivaCT40.pdf)).

- ***02. TINA Protocol.docx*** — TINA (TINA Is No Acronym) landmarking protocol adapted from ‘*The TINA Geometric Morphometrics Toolkit*’ ([Bromiley, Ragheb, and Thacker, 2012](http://www.tina-vision.net/docs/memos/2010-007.pdf)).
